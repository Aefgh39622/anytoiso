### [AnyToISO](https://www.crystalidea.com/anytoiso)

Though AnyToISO is not open-source, we use this GitHub repository to track bugs, feature requests and technical support problems. [See issues](https://github.com/crystalidea/anytoiso/issues)

# Translating the app

The repository also contains AnyToISO [translations](/languages) as .xml files. If you feel confortable with git, you can simply create a pull request to update your translation or create a new one. Always leave %1 (%s), %2, etc in the string, it's a replacement pattern required by the program. For example the string "Package %1 opened" will be expanded to "Package firefox4pre opened" when opening Firefox browser package.

# Release archive 

[Release archive](https://github.com/crystalidea/anytoiso/releases) contains the list of binaries for every version of the app with release notes.
